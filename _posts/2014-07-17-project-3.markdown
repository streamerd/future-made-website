description: Project will introduce a concept, called “a time period ahead”, aka. "demand-on-air", to be able to spread the gathering of "organic", semi-promising demands in time (even years, for regular/on-site art events), and already started on experimenting and implementing an efficiently transparent and anonymous framework.

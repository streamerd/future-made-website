                       We are making an open call for all individuals and communities of the world; who are into ideation, design, research, 
                       and development activities on observing the civic engagements and <strong>the impact of demand-side-initiated 
                           future scenarios (aka. demand-augmentation)</strong> and creating opportunities to extend the

                        Future seems to be observable, when there is an observable future-oriented intention bases exist. 
                        Otherwise, there will be an ongoing need for historical-data that is being collected by some, in real-time. 
                        We should be ready for a future, where all ads are blocked because of the known and being experienced/forced, bad practices.

                        Our technology-enabled projects have also inspired from <a>Community Supported Agriculture,</a> where a future clarity is given to farmers by the consumers.
